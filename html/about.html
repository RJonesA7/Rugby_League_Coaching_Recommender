          <h2>What this tool does</h2>
          <p>
            This web app produces coaching recommendations for an upcoming match based on an
            input profile of the opposition. The input is expressed as z-scores
            (standardised values), so a slider value of 0 represents “league average”, +1 means “one standard
            deviation above average”, and −1 means “one standard deviation below average”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The output is a ranked set of statistics or stat-themes that the system estimates are most worth targeting
            against that specific opposition profile.
          </p>

          <h2>How it works</h2>

          <div class="about-steps">

            <div class="about-step">
              <h3>1) Retrieve similar opposition cases</h3>
              <p>
                Given your opposition input, the system finds historical matches with a similar opposition profile using a
                nearest neighbour search through a database of over 8000 NRL matches.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-step">
              <h3>2) Fit a weighted model on the fly</h3>
              <p>
                Using the retrieved historical cases, the app fits a weighted regression model. More similar cases receive
                more weight, so the fitted model is tailored to the specific opposition context.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-step">
              <h3>3) Turn explanations into recommendations</h3>
              <p>
                The model’s predictions are explained using SHAP contribution values. The explanations for the most
                positive predictions made by the model are averaged, and returned as recommendations.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-step">
              <h3>Player level</h3>
              <p>
                In player level mode, the same logic is applied per position group (middles, halves, etc.). The system retrieves
                similar opposition position-group cases and fits matchup conditioned models, producing recommendations per position group.

        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>How to interpret the numbers</h2>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Z-scores (inputs):</strong> relative to season averages; + means the opposition tends to do more of that thing than average.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation scores (outputs):</strong> relative importance weights from the explanation layer; larger magnitude means more influence.</li>
            <li><strong>Sign:</strong> positive vs negative indicates direction of influence under the fitted model, not a guaranteed causal effect.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>Limitations</h2>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Not causal:</strong> recommendations are based on patterns in historical data, not controlled experiments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feature dependence:</strong> many rugby statistics are correlated, which can make attribution methods less stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Context loss:</strong> match events, injuries, weather, and tactics aren’t fully captured in box-score stats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>“Similarity” is a choice:</strong> the nearest-neighbour feature set defines what “similar opposition” means.
            </li>
          </ul>
